It turn out, there are many many bencoder libs on GitHub,
some are broken and return false info hashes..
Many of these modules share the same module name. Meaning if you pip install Lib B, it could be that now Lib A will return a false infohash.


in this dir there are a few working examples...


when running into problem, be sure to check:
```
pip freeze | grep -i ben
pip list | grep -i ben
pip list --user | grep -i ben
```
